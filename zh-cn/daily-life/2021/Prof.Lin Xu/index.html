<span id="more"></span>
<h2 id="Prof-Lin-Xu">Prof.Lin Xu</h2>
<p>As a new ‘SISTor’ in ShanghaiTech, I feel very exciting, proud, and really lucky. Just the same as my dear colleagues who have shared their experiences, I would like to tell<br>
you my own story. But my story will be a little different, I believe.</p>
<p>I was born in a small village in the south of Sichuan privince, where people were poor, struggling just for food and clothes. I had to stay at home for one year doing<br>
nothing before meeting the age requirement of a primary school, just for saving 5 RMB. Although the financial situation was not good, my childhood was very happy,<br>
because, as a child, I did not have any awareness about finance, Instead, what I had were plenty of play time, plenty of little fellows, and plenty of game places,<br>
e.g., wild fields, small hills, and rivers. Moreover, we did not have any extra course. In this sense, we were much luckier than today’s kids, particularly the Shanghai kids.</p>
<p>I stood out soon after I went to the village’s primary school, especially in math. Like most of my dear colleagues, I also had a dream to become a scientist<br>
or an engineer, even though I did not know what a scientist and an engineer really did. It turned out in my later life, this dream was too luxury.<br>
Anyway, gradually, I became the so called ‘neighbor’s kid’ and also the hope of my family since it seemed possible for me to change my life by education,<br>
which was the only way to leave the countryside for kid like me. Fortunately, I made it. In 1996, I graduated from the middle school with top ranking, meeting<br>
the entrance requirements of the best high school in my home county as well as the technical secondary school.<br>
As Prof.Pingqiang Zhou mentioned in the first issue of the SIS newsletter, in 1980s and early 1990s, graduation from a technical secondary school guaranteed a<br>
job from the government or the state-owned enterprises, and it took only 3 or 4 years after middle school. Therefore, a technical secondary school was cost-effective<br>
and usually the first choice for most of the best students from the countryside. But, actually, I preferred to go to the high school and then a university to pursue<br>
my dream. Unfortunately, I had to give it up and picked a technical secondary school due to family’s financial situation.<br>
This was the first time that I was aware of the impact of finance on my life.</p>
<p>Four years later, I graduated from the technical secondary school with honors and was offered to be recommended for admission to a university without<br>
exams. Once again, I rejected this offer due to the same goddam financial reason, and then accepted the assigned job in a state-owned enterprise.<br>
I still remember my first salary, i.e., 304 RMB, with which I started to live on myself and partially shouldered the burden of my family, e.g., supporting<br>
my younger sister for her high school expenses. I was just 19 years old at that moment. Kids with this age should have sat in a spacious and bright classroom<br>
absorbing all kinds of invaluable knowledge rather than struggling for living. I was just like half-grouted rice which should have enjoyed the warm sunshine<br>
and sweet water and grown rapidly, but were harvested too early.</p>
<p>Back to my job. It was an ordinary worker rather than a cadre. An ordinary worker and a cadre were the two fundamental markers for employees<br>
in a state-owned enterprise. You may have no idea how huge the gap between them was, but just keep in mind, most of the ordinary workers were<br>
not able to cross this gap even exhausting the whole efforts of their entire career. Coming from the countryside without any social resource,<br>
I did not think God would shed special light on me such that I could cross the gap, although I was almost there six years later.<br>
Furthermore, I did not like the tasks of this job. I worked in a heat-treatment workshop. What I did was to put (manually) the metal material,<br>
sometimes very large and heavy, into an electric resistance furnace and take them out after a certain period and then chill them with water or<br>
special liquid, in order to alter their physical properties.<br>
Today, some software engineers describe their work as ‘moving bricks’ with self-deprecating humor. But my work was really ‘moving metal’, seriously.<br>
For me, it was just physical labor requiring no professional knowledge nor skills. Every health adult could do that after a couple of month training.<br>
The only good thing was that, after work, I ate well, slept well, and never had hair-loss problem. But what was the value of my four-year study<br>
in the techniical secondary school? And what about my childhood dream? Although I had to give up the opportunity to a university twice, I had never<br>
given up my dream, ever. So what should I do?</p>
<p>Again, education became the straw which might be able to save my drowning life.<br>
I took the self-study higher education examination, choosing mechatronics as my major, which was quite different from heat treatment<br>
and therefore really challenging. I did the fulltime job and studied the machatronics in the late evening, during what time people<br>
around me were having all kinds of fun. As indicated by the name ‘self-study’, I was totally on myself without any external help,<br>
any teacher, nor any classmate. What I had were a textbook, a syllabus, and several copies of previous exams for each course.<br>
Unlike today, it was not easy to get information through the internet since I could not even afford for a computer at that moment.<br>
So basically I had to understand the textbook and figure out every single problem by my self.<br>
One example, for the course ‘Microcomputer principle and interface technology’, there were lots of concepts I had never heard before.<br>
The first time I just read it as a novel and tried to understand its structure. Then I repeated reading, thinking, reading, thinking, …,<br>
and finally passed the exam with a score of 91. But this was only one course, and I had to pass more than 30 courses in order to obtain<br>
a bachelor degree. The whole process took me six years, which were the most difficult but also the most valuable years in my life.<br>
It was a treasure from the God, I guess, because as Mengzi said, if the God wanted you to do something really big, he would first blablabla…<br>
So, thank you, my God, but what was the thing really big? Oh perhaps it was ShanghaiTech, I did not get it until recently.</p>
<p>After finishing the bachelor, I made a big decision: to take the National Graduate Entrance Examination (NGEE) with target at University<br>
of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). I believed it was this decision that led me to an academic career, and finally to<br>
ShanghaiTech.<br>
Just like throwing a little into the quiet water, this news spread soon all over the factory and resulted in quite some<br>
surprise, doubt, laugh, …, but no trust.<br>
I have seen all kinds of eyes and faces; from which I could hear sounds like ‘are you kidding?’, ‘it is impossible’, et al. Well, nothing<br>
is impossible.<br>
So just let it be. I ignored all sounds outside and was preparing for the exam following my own pace.</p>
<p>An even bigger news came two months later (three months before the NGEE): I rejected a promotion to a cadre (the League secretary)<br>
because it was accompanied by the condition of giving up the NGEE.<br>
As I said before, in a state-owned enterprise, the gap between a worker and a cadre was so huge that most workers could not cross<br>
it during their entire career.<br>
So in all people’s minds, I should grab this opportunity. However, they were not me, the ‘stupid’ guy who chose the NGEE which was<br>
labeled as impossible. To be honest, I alse cloud not predict the NGEE result at that moment. But what I knew was the this was my<br>
last chance to a university pursuing my dream, and if I missed this one I would miss it completely and would definitely regret it<br>
in the rest of my life. I alse knew that I cloud live with the worst NGEE reult.<br>
So why not? People did not understand me except for my family. My parents and two sisters always trusted me, encouraged me,<br>
and supported me.<br>
Other people felt like ‘are you crazy’? Yes, I was crazy. I was crazy because this time I could follow the inside of my heart without<br>
considering the goddam finance. I was crazy alse because I felt so colse to my dream, only missing the final shot.<br>
I felt full of energy in every single nerve and every single cell of my body.<br>
As a man, I was fighting against the fate, which, I believe, should only be ontrolled in my own hands.</p>
<p>The biggest news came along with the warm sunshine and plaeasant spring breeze: I made it.<br>
Again, I saw all kinds of interesting eyes and faces.<br>
But this time, the underlying sounds were different.<br>
The rest of my life was much easier.<br>
I finished my master study at UESTC and then went to boroad for a Ph.D. at the Eindhoven University of Technology,<br>
where I also did my postdoc training.<br>
When I started looking for a faculty position, ShanghaiTech came into my mind immediately since I knew it quite a few years ago,<br>
from my middle school classmate and friend, Prof. Ji Hu, assistant professor at SLST in ShanghaiTech.<br>
It was interesting that, different from me choosing the techinical secondary school,<br>
Ji went to the high school and then a university.<br>
But this was not the point. The thing was that he was that he was a full professor at Xi’an Jiaotong University before joining<br>
in ShanghaiTech as assistant professor in 2014. And he was not the only case.<br>
I noticed, almost during the same period, another full professor at Nanjing University joined in ShanghaiTech as associate<br>
professor, although he was promoted soon.<br>
I was so surprised, just like people hearing that I rejected the cadre position.<br>
I was curious about what kind of university ShanghaiTech was.<br>
After extensive learning about her tenure-track system, founding and education philosophy, high academic freedom,<br>
as well as the competitive salary and benefits, I understood their choices.<br>
Since then, ShanghaiTech had become my dream insitute to develop an academic career.</p>
<p>Again I made it. I received the offer a couple of days after the on-site interview, and accepted it without hesitation.<br>
I joined in ShanghaiTech in Sep.2019, with education and research interests focused on biomedical signal processing and<br>
its application in neuromuscular rehabilitation and ambulatory health monitoring.<br>
To me, like was miraculous. As you see, me and Ji started from the same village school, then followd two totally different<br>
trajectories, but finally met again in ShanghaiTech, which confirmed, once again, the very old saying: ‘All roads lead to Rome’.<br>
To make it more specific, perhaps I cloud say: ‘All roads lead to ShanghaiTech, sooner or later’. So, just be prepared and patient.<br>
And, to make it even further, I would say ‘All roads lead to the same destination - end of the life’. So, just cherish and enjoy<br>
every single minute and every single scene in our lives.</p>
